<a id="upgrading-from-moodle-19-20-or-21" class="anchor" href="#upgrading-from-moodle-19-20-or-21" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Upgrading from Moodle 1.9, 2.0 or 2.1</h2>

<p>Moodle 2.4 requires that Moodle 2.2 is installed to upgrade from, so therefore Moodle 2.2 is an intermediate step.
So:
1. Put Moodle in 'Maintenance Mode' so that there are no users using it bar you as the administrator.
2. In '/course/format/' move old 'topcoll' directory to a backup folder outside of Moodle.
3. Do not copy in the new version of 'topcoll' yet!  As this will cause the upgrade to fail.
4. Upgrade to Moodle 2.2 first - <a href="http://docs.moodle.org/22/en/Upgrading_to_Moodle_2.2">http://docs.moodle.org/22/en/Upgrading_to_Moodle_2.2</a>.
5. After you have installed Moodle 2.2, now upgrade to Moodle 2.4 with this new topcoll -
   <a href="http://docs.moodle.org/24/en/Upgrading_to_Moodle_2.4">http://docs.moodle.org/24/en/Upgrading_to_Moodle_2.4</a> - but before initiating the upgrade you can copy the
   new (i.e. this) 'topcoll' folder to '/course/format'.
6. Now follow 'Upgrading from Moodle 2.2' below please.
INFO: Having no 'topcoll' folder in '/course/format' is fine as the courses that use it are not accessed and
      both the old and new versions will confuse an intermediate 2.2 version and cause it's installation to fail.</p>

<a id="upgrading-from-moodle-22" class="anchor" href="#upgrading-from-moodle-22" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Upgrading from Moodle 2.2</h2>

<ol>
<li>   Put Moodle in 'Maintenance Mode' so that there are no users using it bar you as the administrator - if you have
  not already done so.</li>
<li>   In '/course/format/' move old 'topcoll' directory to a backup folder outside of Moodle - if you have not
  already done so.</li>
<li>   Copy this new 'topcoll' folder to '/course/format/'.</li>
<li>   Upgrade to Moodle 2.4 by being logged in as 'admin' and clicking on 'Home'.  If you have previously upgraded but
  'topcoll' was an old version and the upgrade failed, this should still work.</li>
<li>   Follow installation instructions above.</li>
<li>   Put Moodle out of Maintenance Mode.
NOTE: If the automated upgrade fails for which can be seen by getting errors when using a Collapsed Topics course,
  then please follow this.
  Please carry on if a table / field has been removed / changed / already exists as it should still work - this 
  is to cope with the different possible scenarios.  These instructions are written with the MySQL database in
  mind, however should work with other database engines but the types should be compared with other tables in 
  the database to get an idea of what they should be.  If possible please kindly feedback to me any additional
  information you discover so I can update these instructions - contact details at the very bottom.
  The table prefix i.e, 'mdl_' is not stated in the instructions but ensure you know what yours is and use
  it with the table names.</li>
<li>   In your database:
2.1   Rename the table 'format_topcoll_layout' to 'format_topcoll_settings'.
2.2   With the table 'format_topcoll_settings' change all integer types to signed if using a MySQL database.
2.3   If the table 'format_topcoll_settings' does not exist, then create it and add the following fields 
  in this order:
2.3.1 'id' of type 'BIGINT(10)' type, not null, auto increment, no zero fill with a null default value - the same 
   as any other 'id' field in the other tables.  Make it the primary key.
2.3.2 'courseid' of type 'BIGINT(10)' type, not null, no auto increment, no zero fill with a null default value - the
  same as the 'course' field in the 'course_sections' table bar the default value.
2.3.3 'layoutelement' of type 'TINYINT(2)' type, not null, no auto increment, no zero fill with a default value
  of '1'.
2.3.4 'layoutstructure' of type 'TINYINT(1)' type, not null, no auto increment, no zero fill with a default value
  of '1'.
2.4   With the table 'format_topcoll_settings' append three new fields of 'VARCHAR(6)' type, not null, called
  'tgfgcolour', 'tgbgcolour' and 'tgbghvrcolour' in that order with the default values of '000000', 'e2e2f2'
  and 'eeeeff' respectively.
2.5   With the table 'format_topcoll_settings' append a new field 'layoutcolumns' after the 'layoutstructure' field
  and with identical size, type and attributes.  The default is '1'. i.e:
2.5.1 'layoutcolumns' of type 'TINYINT(1)' type, not null, no auto increment, no zero fill with a default value
  of '1'.
2.6   Drop the table 'format_topcoll_cookie_cnsnt'.</li>

<a id="uninstallation" class="anchor" href="#uninstallation" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Uninstallation</h1>

<ol>
<li>Put Moodle in 'Maintenance Mode' so that there are no users using it bar you as the administrator.</li>
<li>It is recommended but not essential to change all of the courses that use the format to another.  If this is
not done Moodle will pick the last format in your list of formats to use but display in 'Edit settings' of the
course the first format in the list.  You can then set the desired format.</li>
<li>In '/course/format/' remove the folder 'topcoll'.</li>
<li>In the database, remove the table 'format_topcoll_settings' along with the entry for 'format_topcoll'
('plugin' attribute) in the table 'config_plugins'.  If using the default prefix this will be
'mdl_format_topcoll_settings' and 'mdl_config_plugins' respectively.</li>
<li>Put Moodle out of Maintenance Mode.</li>
</ol>

<h1>
<a id="course-backup-and-restore-instructions" class="anchor" href="#course-backup-and-restore-instructions" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Course Backup and Restore Instructions</h1>

<ol>
<li>Backup as you would any other course.  The layout configuration will be stored with the course settings.</li>
<li>Restore as you would any other course.  If you are offered the option of 'Overwrite Course Configuration'
you must say 'Yes' to have the layout configuration restored otherwise the restored course will retain the
layout it previously had or the default in the 'config.php' file as mentioned in the 'Installation'
instructions above depending on the situation.</li>
<li>Note: I believe that if you restore a Collapsed Topic's course on an installation that does not have the
     format then it will work and become the default course format.  However the layout data will not be
     stored if you install Collapsed Topic's at a later date.</li>
</ol>

<h1>
<a id="remembered-toggle-state-information" class="anchor" href="#remembered-toggle-state-information" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Remembered Toggle State Information</h1>

<p>The state of the toggles are remembered beyond the session on a per user per course basis though the employment
of a user preference.  This functionality is now built in from previous versions.  You do not need to do anything.</p>

<h1>
<a id="icon-sets" class="anchor" href="#icon-sets" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Icon Sets</h1>

<p>Icon sets allow you to choose what is the most appropriate set of icons to use for a given courses demographic.  They
are set on a per course basis but with all the functionality of the other settings in respect to a default and resetting
the current or all courses.</p>

<p>If you want to change what icon represents which state / action, then edit 'styles.css' and change the selectors with
the 'background' attribute with a 'toggle-...' type class within them.  There are selectors for both the 'toggles' and
the 'toggle all' functionality.  For example:</p>

<pre><code>body.jsenabled .course-content ul.ctopics li.section .content .toggle-arrow a.toggle_closed {
    background-image: url([[pix:format_topcoll|arrow_right]]);
}

#toggle-all .content .toggle-arrow h4 a.off {
    background-image: url([[pix:format_topcoll|arrow_down]]); 
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you would like your own icon set, either replace the icons in the 'pix' folder, deduce how the code works or better
still create new icons yourself and ask me to add them to the release.  If you do the latter then the icons must be your
own for which you grant the same GPL licence as <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">Moodle</a> or provide direct evidence
of the originator under the same licence.  The icons must be 24x24 pixels with a transparent background.</p>

<h1>
<a id="known-issues" class="anchor" href="#known-issues" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Known Issues</h1>

<ol>
<li> If you get toggle text issues in languages other than English please ensure you have the latest version of Moodle installed.
More information on <a href="http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=184150">http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=184150</a>.</li>
<li> Importing a Moodle 1.9 course does not currently work, please see CONTRIB-3552 which depends on MDL-32205 - as
a workaround, please select the 'Topics' format first in 1.9, backup and restore then select the Collapsed Topics
course format in the course settings.  You will have to reset your decisions on structure etc.</li>
<li> Sometimes when restoring a course, it is accessed for the first time and a toggle is clicked a 'Error updating user
preference 'topcoll_toggle_x'' (where 'x' is the course id as shown in the URL 'id=x') can occur.  I'm not completely sure
why this is happening as the 'user_preference_allow_ajax_update' call in 'format.php' should establish that the user
preference can be set.  Could be a page cache thing as the 'init' code is getting the course id unlike an issue I'm
currently experiencing with the MyMobile theme - MDL-33115.  The work around is to refresh the page.  Having altered some
of the event handing code to operate after page load, I'm hoping that this has now been resolved, please let me know
if you encounter it.</li>
</ol>

<h1>
<a id="reporting-issues" class="anchor" href="#reporting-issues" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Reporting Issues</h1>

<p>Before reporting an issue, please ensure that you are running the latest version for your release of Moodle.  The primary
release area is located on <a href="https://moodle.org/plugins/view.php?plugin=format_topcoll">https://moodle.org/plugins/view.php?plugin=format_topcoll</a>.  It is also essential that you are
operating the required version of Moodle as stated at the top - this is because the format relies on core functionality that
is out of its control.</p>

<p>All Collapsed Topics does is integrate with the course page and control it's layout, therefore what may appear to be an issue
with the format is in fact to do with a theme or core component.  Please be confident that it is an issue with Collapsed Topics
but if in doubt, ask.</p>

<p>I operate a policy that we will fix all genuine issues for free (this only applies to the code as supplied from the sources listed
in 'Downloads and documentation' above.  Any changes / improvements you make are not covered and invalidate this policy for all of
the code).  Improvements are at my discretion.  I am happy to make bespoke customisations / improvements for a negotiated fee.  I
will endeavour to respond to all requests for support as quickly as possible, if you require a faster service then offering payment
for the service will expedite the response.</p>

<p>When reporting an issue you can post in the course format's forum on Moodle.org (currently 'moodle.org/mod/forum/view.php?id=47'), 
on Moodle tracker 'tracker.moodle.org' ensuring that you chose the 'Non-core contributed modules' and 'Course Format: Topcoll'
for the component or contact me direct (details at the bottom).</p>

<p>It is essential that you provide as much information as possible, the critical information being the contents of the format's 
version.php file.  Other version information such as specific Moodle version, theme name and version also helps.  A screen shot
can be really useful in visualising the issue along with any files you consider to be relevant.</p>
